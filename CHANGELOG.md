# Changelog

## 0.11.0

### Removed

- **AI Summary feature temporarily removed** — the Copilot-powered AI summary generation has been fully removed pending a safer rollout (see [issue #20](https://github.com/Nimblesite/CommandTree/issues/20)). Reason: the previous activation path could silently fan out one Copilot request per discovered command on install and on every script edit, picking the first available model (often a premium one), which could consume a large share of a user's Copilot quota without warning. The feature will return once request volume is bounded, premium models are gated behind explicit consent, and the user is asked before any Copilot quota is spent.
- `commandtree.enableAiSummaries` and `commandtree.aiModel` settings (no longer wired)
- `commandtree.generateSummaries` and `commandtree.selectModel` commands (no longer wired)
- All Copilot integration code (`semantic/summariser.ts`, `semantic/modelSelection.ts`) and the AI portions of `semantic/summaryPipeline.ts` and `summaryOrchestration.ts`

### Notes

- Tooltips still render any summaries already stored in the local SQLite DB; only generation is removed
- Command discovery, registration, tagging, Quick Launch, and execution are unchanged

## 0.9.0

### Changed

- Repository transferred to the [Nimblesite](https://github.com/Nimblesite/CommandTree) organisation; all links updated

### Fixed

- Release process fixes
- SEO improvements across the website

## 0.8.0

### Changed

- Maintenance release

## 0.7.0

### Added

- **Mise task discovery** — discovers tasks from `mise.toml`, `.mise.toml`, `mise.yaml`, and `.mise.yaml`, including task descriptions
- TOML parser now recognises `[tasks.name]` sections without requiring a bare `[tasks]` preamble
- Pure `parsers/miseParser.ts` extracted for testability
- Lock recovery spec and `[DISC-PARSE-STRATEGY]` parsing strategy spec
- Cross-platform `Makefile` with OS detection, help target, and standardised public/private targets

### Changed

- Bumped supported command count to 22 (adds Mise alongside C# Script and F# Script)
- DB layer simplified — `initSchema`, `registerCommand`, `ensureCommandExists`, `closeDatabase`, tag mutators, `upsertSummary`, etc. now return directly and throw only on unrecoverable errors. New `getDbOrThrow()` replaces repeated `getDb()` + `Result` unwrapping
- `CommandTreeProvider`, `QuickTasksProvider`, `TagConfig`, `extension.ts`, `TaskRunner`, and `summaryPipeline` simplified by removing `Result` unwrapping boilerplate
- `CLAUDE.md` / `Agents.md` consolidated with logging standards, spec ID rules, and updated command table
- `.prettierrc` renamed to `.prettierrc.json` with explicit settings
- `.gitignore` expanded with universal patterns and secret exclusions
- Docs reorganised into `docs/specs/` and `docs/plans/`
- Coverage thresholds updated to reflect current coverage
- README updated for 22 tool types

### Removed

- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (superseded by `release.yml` post-release job)
- Stale `CoveragePlan.md`

## 0.6.0

### Added

- **C# Script (.csx) discovery** via new `discovery/csharp-script.ts`
- **F# Script (.fsx) discovery** via new `discovery/fsharp-script.ts`
- Reusable helpers extracted: `powershellParser.ts`, `nodeFactory.ts`, `tagSync.ts`, `watchers.ts`
- New unit test suites: `discovery.unit.test.ts`, `modelSelection.unit.test.ts`, `taskRunner.unit.test.ts`, `treehierarchy.unit.test.ts`
- CI format check, spell check, and 90% coverage threshold
- Claude skills: `ci-prep`, `fix-bug`
- Rust LSP plan and spec docs

### Changed

- Refactored `CommandTreeProvider`, `QuickTasksProvider`, and `TagConfig` for reduced complexity and a more functional style
- Reorganised semantic/db layer — moved `db.ts` from `semantic/` to `db/` and added `lifecycle.ts`
- Replaced fake/indirect tests with proper E2E coverage
- Tightened ESLint, Prettier, and `tsconfig` rules
- Split `SPEC.md` into focused docs

### Removed

- Unused embedding modules: `embedder.ts`, `embeddingPipeline.ts`, `similarity.ts`, `store.ts`, plus related types and index
- Copilot-dependent tests excluded from CI

## 0.5.0

### Added

- **GitHub Copilot AI Summaries** — discovered commands are automatically summarised in plain language by GitHub Copilot, displayed in tooltips on hover
- Security warnings: commands that perform dangerous operations (e.g. `rm -rf`, force-push) are flagged with a warning in the tree view
- `commandtree.enableAiSummaries` setting to toggle AI summaries (enabled by default)
- `commandtree.generateSummaries` command to manually trigger summary generation
- Content-hash change detection — summaries only regenerate when scripts change

### Fixed

- Terminal execution no longer throws when xterm viewport is uninitialised in headless environments

## 0.4.0

### Added

- SQLite storage for summaries and embeddings via `node-sqlite3-wasm`
- Automatic migration from legacy JSON store to SQLite on activation
- File watcher re-summarises scripts when they change, with user notification

### Fixed

- Corrected homepage link to commandtree.dev in package.json and README
- Fixed website deployment prefix issue for custom domain

## 0.3.0

### Added

- Demo GIF showcasing CommandTree in action on README and website
- Website demo section with window-chrome frame and caption below the hero
- Deployment script fix for release workflow
